# Hello world
## This my first post
A new blog site built with Hugo.
Future deploy with Netlify.

### The testing continues
Trying to finalise git and then will set-up Netlify.

### Deploying with Netlify
- Successfully changed DNS nameservers to point to Netlify.
- Successfully enabled https.
- Netlify domain works and shows the website.
- BUT my domain doesn't seem to work yet... Maybe needs more time for the nameservers to refresh on the Netlify's part? 


## It's LIVE!
It was after all, the DNS refresh time from Netlify that was at 1 hour, so probably that needed to wait and refresh. So all in all after changing nameserves to my domain provider it takes approximately 2 hours for the website to be deployed by Netlify.
