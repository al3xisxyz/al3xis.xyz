# Hello world
## This my first post
A new blog site built with Hugo.
Future deploy with Netlify.

## The testing continues
Trying to finalise git and then will set-up Netlify.

## Deploying with Netlify
- Successfully changed DNS namesaervers to point to Netlify.
- Successfully enabled https.
- Netlify domain works and shows the website.
- BUT my domain doesn't seem to work yet... Maybe needs more time for the nameservers to refresh on the Netlify's part? 

# It's LIVE!
It was after all the DNS refresh time from Netlify that was at 1 hour so probably that needed to wait and refresh.
